#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) 0(n) because we only ever run 1 operation and we loop through our operation n times


b)0(n^2) because we have a nested operation a while loop within a for loop


c)Though were invoking a function within a function 0 complexity would still be 0(n)

## Exercise II

    So I would take the divide and conquer approach or a binery search approach. 
    
    1.) First I would test the mid point of the building.
        Now "If" egg breaks or "else if" egg doesnt break 
        will determine if I remove the upper half or lower half
    
    
    2.) So "if" the Egg did break I would be able to remove the
        upper half of the building out of the equation and test
        the mid point of the lower half and vice versa if the egg
        didnt break.
        
    3.) I would continue this approach until we found the "Sweet Spot"
        and at the same time minimize the amount of eggs needed to drop 
        
      BIG 0 COMPLEXITY
         0(logN)
